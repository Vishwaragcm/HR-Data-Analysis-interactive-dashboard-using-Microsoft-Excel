# HR-Data-Analysis-interactive-dashboard-using-Microsoft-Excel
Created an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Excel to analyze employee attrition trends by department, age, and tenure. Utilized Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers to visualize key HR metrics such as attrition rate, headcount, and hiring ratio. Helped HR teams identify high-risk areas and improve retention strategies.
The dashboard showcased KPIs including total headcount, attrition rate, average tenure, hiring vs. attrition ratio, and department-wise turnover. Slicers and filters were integrated for interactive data exploration by age, gender, and job role.

The attrition analysis highlighted departments and experience levels with higher turnover rates, enabling HR managers to implement data-driven retention initiatives.

Tools & Techniques: Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, Data Validation, Slicers).
Outcome: Improved understanding of attrition trends and provided actionable insights for HR decision-making and workforce planning.
